> Wanted to make api for storing things that i like with some description and kinda personal score

I would like to make telegram bot for API and use it for I/O method instead WEB app. But during developing telegram bot i found some lack of performance. It feeled viscous and not that fast as wanted.

So i make a desicion to learn GO lang and try remade it with GO.

At this stage, the API is fully functional and can be used on its own.

`dumper.bat` -> make dumpfile from postgresql container
`restorer.bat` -> restore information from dumpfile into psql container
